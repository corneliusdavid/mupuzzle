MU Puzzle
==========

Inspired by the book, "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid", this program aids in exploring 
the MU Puzzle presented there. It deals with manipulating sequences of "M"s and "U"s using certain 
rules to try to come up with a specific pattern of characters. This is a prime example of a programmer
looking for an excuse to write a program!

Written in Delphi 1, still compiles in Delphi 10.2 Tokyo.

Now ported to:
* C# using WinForms on Windows Desktop
* C# using XAML for .NET WPF on Windows Desktop
* Oxygene using XAML for .NET WPF one Windows Desktop
* Oxygene using XAML for Windows Phone 8
